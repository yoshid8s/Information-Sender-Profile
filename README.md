# Originator Profile for Web advertising ecosystem

The global industry standard for digital advertising to curb fake news, foster good journalism and contribute to a "healthy web information space".

# One of the reason why information space on the web is confusing is digital advertising

Ad industry should contribute to the growth of healthy information space on the web in order to realize sustainability of ad industry.
Consumers privacy protection is one of this challenge Ad industry must solve.
Information space on the web is confusing now. One of its cause is digital advertising.

### The purpose of anonymous people creating "disinformation" is getting digital advertising money.
There are sensational informations about occurring pandemic source of COVID19 on the web.  
When I had accessed such disinformation page via Facebook feeds on February 2020, I had come across some very famous Japanese brand's advertisements by sent through RTB advertising system.
But such sensational webpages have almost no evidence to their articles. 
Anonymous writer of these webpages won’t take responsibility for article even if it is apparent that this webpage contains disinformation/misinformation.
Because the operators of these webpages only want to get ad money, they don't need to take responsibility to whether such articles is true or not.
These situations are pointed out by [Prof. Shinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) on [HBR's article](https://hbr.org/2018/07/truth-disrupted).
In my opinion, many creators of disinformations are highly skilled technologist who know the detail of RTB ad system rather than journalist.

### Mass media journalism is in financial difficult situation because its ad revenue is devastatingly decreasing.
The data sources of below figure is refered from [The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association]( https://www.pressnet.or.jp/data/finance/finance01.php ).
<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/newspaper_decline.png" alt="newspaper_decline" width="480" height="300">

Japanese Newspaper revenue is dropping year by year. 
Total Sales revenue from 2004 to present have dropped to 76%.
Total Ad revenue from 2004 to present has dropped to 44% !
This is presumed to have a direct negative impact on the quality of journalism content.
Now, Japanese traditional media outlets journalists are forced in environment to write article without fully examination in order to get more impression number of their articles on the web.
This means that Journalism is under pressure in order to get ad money. Such pressure to journalists might cause quality down of their journals.
This is very unfortunate situation.

### Also in Japan, "Paywall" on digital newspaper is emerging. 
According to the research [Press Research Institute](https://www.chosakai.gr.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/shinbun/asset/pdf/project/notification/jpyoronreport10-2017.pdf),
Many Japanese (65.5%) does not want to use digital newspaper for a fee.
This means that mass media journalism institution's opinion can not reach to many people near the future especially younger persons.
Digital advertising should be one of the solution to this problem.

### Ordinary consumers are easily deceived by “Fake ad” of malicious advertisers
According to [TV research report program of NHK](http://www.nhk.or.jp/gendai/articles/1885/index.html), there are many cases that consumers became victims by “Fake ad”.
"Fake ad" NHK found was created illegally without one famous lady actress’s agreement.
Ordinary consumers can not discern these fake ad. 

Malicious advertisers also use the vulnerability of RTB ad system to run “Fake ad” in the same way anonymous publishers disseminate disinformation.

# These situations are caused by three “asymmetries”
### 1st asymmetry is the situation in information analytical literacy existing between Sender and Receiver

  <img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/asymmetry1.png" alt="First Asymmetry" title="First Asymmetry" width="400" height="500"> 
  Sender (Publisher & Advertiser) have various tool analyzing Receiver’s profile and can send personalized ads to consumers by using RTB ad system .
When Sender is not famous brand,Receiver (Consumer) have not any tool now to research what kind of person or institution is sending the information or ad to them and decide whether the sender is trustable or not .

### 2nd asymmetry is the attitude to responsibility of published articles existing between brand media outlets and anonymous web publishers

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/asymmetry2.png" alt="2nd Asymmetry" title="2nd Asymmetry" width="1096" height="400">
Anonymous web publishers are easily able to write unconfirmed articles and get digital ad money 
because they don’t need to take responsibility to their no evidence article.

### 3rd asymmetry is the attitude to brand reputation existing between brand advertisers and malicious advertisers

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/asymmetry3.png" alt="3rd Asymmetry" title="3rd Asymmetry" width="968" height="400">
Malicious advertisers even deceive consumers by using famous other company's brand name in order to make money. Unfortunately, since RTB ad marketplace is building on the premise that every advertiser is fundamentally good, digital ad industry can not exclude such malicious advertisers from RTB ad marketplace.

### Malicious publishers & advertisers are getting digital advertising money by leveraged three asymmetries of RTB advertising market.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Originator-Profile/rtb_ad_market.png" alt="RTB ad marketplace" title="RTB ad marketplace" >
As RTB market place is free and has not a strict qualified system to players, everybody can join its market.
This is built on the premise that everyone is fundamentally good.
Malicious players can join in its market place by leverage of this premise.
Such players are creating sensational webpages containing disinformation or misinformation and they use the character of social network system to disseminate such webpages. 
Many people are accessing such "fake news" pages.
 As the result, advertising slot of these webpages created by malicious players are increasing, and such players are able to get many digital advertising money. 
Moreover, malicious advertisers will deceive many consumers who can not discern whether it is fake ad or not.  

### RTB ad market place's fundamental premise, "every player has good faith",  is causing to disseminate fake news(disinformation/misinformation) 

# Ad industry should solve these three asymmetries in order to realize healthy information space on the web. 
# Solution : Originator Profile as the new function of web browser
I would like to propose to compose the new function solving the asymmetry of information literacy between Sender and Receiver into web browser as an Ad industry standard rule.  
Only publisher and advertiser who is disclosing “Originator Profile” certified by 3rd party to Receiver(Consumer) through web browser can join in RTB ad market place. 

<img src="https://github.com/yoshid8s/Originator-Profile/blob/main/solution1.png" alt="solution" title="solution" width="1000" height="624">

If [Transparency & Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) is built in this “Originator Profile” function of web browser , it will be very kind approach to consumer because she can easily change her media outlets advertising settings.
When "Originator Profile as the new web browser's function" becomes Ad industry's standard and RTB Advertising will be allowed to deliver only publishers and advertisers having Originator Profile, RTB ad marketplace will be able to contribute to build "Healthy information space" on the web.

### Example 1, NEWS media's mobile webpage

# Digital Advertising will foster Healthy web information space if Information Sender Profile’s data is connected to RTB ad market place through API connection

<img src="https://github.com/yoshid8s/Originator-Profile/blob/main/rtb_marketplace1.png" alt="rtb_marketplace" title="rtb_marketplace" width="1000" height="501" >

1. RTB advertising transactions between trusted players are made possible by Originator Profile, which naturally weeds out malicious players  
1. Consumer’s information literacy will be higher thanks to Originator Profile’s information

# JTI standard , a proposal from Journalist side ( RSF ) - Originagor Profile for media outlets 

[RSF ( Reporters Without Borders )](https://rsf.org/) has conducted [Journalism Trust Initiative ( JTI ) project](https://jti-rsf.org/en/) since 2018.
