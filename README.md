# Information Sender Profile for Web advertising ecosystem

The global industry standard for digital advertising to curb fake news, foster good journalism and contribute to a "healthy web information space".

# One of the reason why information space on the web is confusing is digital advertising

Ad industry should contribute to the growth of healthy information space on the web in order to realize sustainability of ad industry.
Consumers privacy protection is one of this challenge Ad industry must solve.
Information space on the web is confusing now. One of its cause is digital advertising.

### The purpose of anonymous people creating "disinformation" is getting digital advertising money.
There are sensational informations about occurring pandemic source of COVID19 on the web.  
When I had accessed such disinformation page via Facebook feeds on February 2020, I had come across some very famous Japanese brand's advertisements by sent through RTB advertising system.
But such sensational webpages have almost no evidence to their articles. 
Anonymous writer of these webpages won’t take responsibility for article even if it is apparent that this webpage contains disinformation/misinformation.
Because the operators of these webpages only want to get ad money, they don't need to take responsibility to whether such articles is true or not.
These situations are pointed out by [Prof. Shinan Aral](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/sinan-kayhan-aral) on [HBR's article](https://hbr.org/2018/07/truth-disrupted).
In my opinion, many creators of disinformations are highly skilled technologist who know the detail of RTB ad system rather than journalist.

### Mass media journalism is in financial difficult situation because its ad revenue is devastatingly decreasing.
The data sources of below figure is refered from [The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association]( https://www.pressnet.or.jp/data/finance/finance01.php ).

Japanese Newspaper revenue is dropping year by year. 
Total Sales revenue from 2004 to present have dropped to 76%.
Total Ad revenue from 2004 to present has dropped to 44% !
This is presumed to have a direct negative impact on the quality of journalism content.
Now, Japanese traditional media outlets journalists are forced in environment to write article without fully examination in order to get more impression number of their articles on the web.
This means that Journalism is under pressure in order to get ad money. Such pressure to journalists might cause quality down of their journals.
This is very unfortunate situation.

### Also in Japan, "Paywall" on digital newspaper is emerging. 
According to the research [Press Research Institute](https://www.chosakai.gr.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/shinbun/asset/pdf/project/notification/jpyoronreport10-2017.pdf),
Many Japanese (65.5%) does not want to use digital newspaper for a fee.
This means that mass media journalism institution's opinion can not reach to many people near the future especially younger persons.
Digital advertising should be one of the solution to this problem.

### Ordinary consumers are easily deceived by “Fake ad” of malicious advertisers
According to [TV research report program of NHK](http://www.nhk.or.jp/gendai/articles/1885/index.html), there are many cases that consumers became victims by “Fake ad”.
"Fake ad" NHK found was created illegally without one famous lady actress’s agreement.
Ordinary consumers can not discern these fake ad 
Malicious advertisers also use the vulnerability of RTB ad system to run “Fake ad” in the same way anonymous publishers disseminate disinformation.

# These situations are caused by three “asymmetry”
### 1st asymmetry is situation in information analytical literacy existing between Sender and Receiver

  Sender (Publisher & Advertiser) have various tool analyzing Receiver’s profile and can send personalized ads to consumers by using RTB ad system .
When Sender is not famous brand,Receiver (Consumer) have not any tool now to research what kind of person or institution is sending the information or ad to them and decide whether the sender is trustable or not .

### 2nd asymmetry is the attitude to responsibility of published articles existing between brand media outlets and anonymous web publishers

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/asymmetry2.png" alt="2nd Asymmetry" title="2nd Asymmetry" width="1096" height="400">
Anonymous web publishers are easily able to write unconfirmed articles and get digital ad money 
because they don’t need to take responsibility to their no evidence article.

### 3rd asymmetry is the attitude to brand reputation existing between brand advertisers and malicious advertisers

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wiki/yoshid8s/Information-Sender-Profile/asymmetry3.png" alt="2nd Asymmetry" title="2nd Asymmetry" width="968" height="400">
Malicious advertisers even deceive consumers by using famous other company's brand name in order to make money. Unfortunately, since RTB ad marketplace is building on the premise that every advertiser is fundamentally good, digital ad industry can not exclude such malicious advertisers from RTB ad marketplace.
